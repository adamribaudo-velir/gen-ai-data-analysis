7/26/2024,sin.csv,CSV,Anthropic,Claude,3.5 Sonnet,I'm uploading a CSV file containing rows of data for each week of the year. Can you interpret the data and tell me if you see any trends?,"Both dimension_a and dimension_b show a cyclical pattern throughout the year, resembling a sine wave….Inverse Relationship: There's still an inverse relationship between dimension_a and dimension_b, but it's more pronounced and rhythmic in this data set.",Pass,
7/26/2024,linear.csv,CSV,OpenAI,ChatGpt,4o,I'm uploading a CSV file containing rows of data for each week of the year. Can you interpret the data and tell me if you see any trends?,Both dimensions exhibit an increasing trend in their metric values over the weeks.,Fail,
7/26/2024,linear.csv,CSV,Anthropic,Claude,3.5 Sonnet,I'm uploading a CSV file containing rows of data for each week of the year. Can you interpret the data and tell me if you see any trends?,There appears to be an inverse relationship between dimension_a and dimension_b.,Pass,
7/26/2024,linear.png,Image,Anthropic,Claude,3.5 Sonnet,I'm uploading a graph showing some data collected each week throughout the year. Can you interpret the data and tell me if you see any trends?,"Opposing trends: The two dimensions show inverse relationships over time. Crossover point: The two lines intersect around week 25-30, indicating a point where the measured values for both dimensions were equal.",Pass,
7/26/2024,sin.png,Image,Anthropic,Claude,3.5 Sonnet,I'm uploading a graph showing some data collected each week throughout the year. Can you interpret the data and tell me if you see any trends?,"Inverse relationship: The two dimensions show a strong inverse correlation throughout the year. Cyclical pattern: The overall pattern suggests a cyclical relationship, possibly indicating seasonal changes or a shift in focus between the two dimensions over the course of the year.",Fail,Picks up on the inverse relationship but fails to describe the sinusoidal pattern
